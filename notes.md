To specify an event, we will write a formula that holds in a particular state of a trace iff :
1. that event can occur in that state - GUARD 
   and 
2. the next state of the trace is a valid outcome of the event - EFFECT



Mutable sets (and relations) are drawn with dashed borders by default, but this can be changed in the theme.
